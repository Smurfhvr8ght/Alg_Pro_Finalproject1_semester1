# Sudoku Game
  <p>A sudoku game made in Python</p>
  <p>This version comes with a leaderboard that keep tracks of your personal best</p>
  <p>Compete with other players (locally) to see who can finish a randomized sudoku puzzle</p>

<h1>How to run</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Download all the files from the repository</li>
    <li>Run the 'Display.py' file located in the 'Final_Project_Year1' folder</li>
  </ul>

<h1>About possible bug</h1>
  <p>The code is made in a way where the 'cd' of the whole code started outside the code</p>
  <p>the file directory in my file looks like: Final_Project_Year1/Asset/[something]</p>
  <p>if there is error about img not found, place it in a random empty folder in ur desktop, it should work</p>
  <p>also don't ask why its called year1 when it should be sem1, i forgot and now have to live with it</p>

<h1>Controls</h1>
  <p>Most of the game will use button and text box as an input method</p>
  <p>for the Sudoku game the there will only be 1 textbox for the input</p>
  <p>the format will be "x-value,y-value,answer"</p>
  <p>the x and y value follows the format of a 2d array (top left is 0,0)</p>
  <p>to remove an answer, just type the x and y axis, then press the 'DEL' button</p>
  <p>use coma to seperate the input</p>
  <p>the textbox has a word limit so try not to spam the keyboard</p>
