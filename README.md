# Alg_Pro_Finalproject1_semester1
<p>This is the  place to access my first final project</p>
<p>my info:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name: Andres</li>
  <li>NIM: 2802501123</li>
</ul>
<p>To run the code please use 'Display.py'. Not 'Testing.py', that is for my debugging.</p>
<h1>About possible bug</h1>
<p>The code is made in a way where the 'cd' of the whole code started outside the code</p>
<p>the file directory in my file looks like: Final_Project_Year1/Asset/[something]</p>
<p>if there is error about img not found, place it in a random empty folder in ur desktop, it should work</p>
<p>also don't ask why its called year1 when it should be sem1, i forgot and now have to live with it</p>
<h1>Controls</h1>
<p>Most of the game will use button and text box as an input method</p>
<p>for the Sudoku game the there will only be 1 textbox for the input</p>
<p>the format will be "x-value,y-value,answer"</p>
<p>the x and y axis follows that of a 2d array</p>
<p>to remove an answer, just type the x and y axis</p>
<p>use coma to seperate the input</p>
<p>the textbox has a length limit so try not to spam the keyboard</p>
