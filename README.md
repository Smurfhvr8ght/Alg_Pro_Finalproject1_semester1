# Alg_Pro_Finalproject1_semester1
<p>This is the  place to access my first final project</p>
<p>my info:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name: Andres</li>
  <li>NIM: 2802501123</li>
</ul>
<h1>About possible bug</h1>
<p>The code is made in a way where the 'cd' of the whole code started outside the code</p>
<p>the file directory in my file looks like: Final_Project_Year1/Asset/[something]</p>
<p>if there is error about img not found, place it in a random empty folder in ur desktop, it should work</p>
<p>also don't ask why its called year1 when it should be sem1, i forgot and now have to live with it</p>
